What is Kolibre-xmlreader?
---------------------------------
Kolibre-xmlreader is a library for fetching and parsing XML data. Kolibre-
xmlreader is a SAX wrapper library for libxml2 and can load 
XML/XHTML/HTML documents from disk or http. A caching function is built in to 
speed up re-parsing of previous XML documents. Kolibre-xmlreader also has an 
optional dependency on libtidy, that can be used as a fallback for cleaning 
up messy and malformed XML files. These features makes the usage of xmlreader 
simple, fast and reliable.

Kolibre-xmlreader has been tested with Linux Debian Squeeze and can be built
using dev packages from apt repositories.

Documentation
---------------------------------
This library is documented using doxygen.

Type ./configure && make doxygen-doc to generate documentation.

Known issues
---------------------------------
There is currently a bug in libxml2 version 2.7.8 causing xml parsing to fail
when the document type declaration contains an empty internal subset declaration.
If this package is compiled with libtidy then tidy will remove the empty
declaration and thus work normally.

The bug has been reported to the libxml2 community along with a patch. Visit
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=684201 to check the status of the bug
or download the patch.
